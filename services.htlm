            <h2>Switch Lubing and Tuning</h2>
            <p>
                One of the most impactful upgrades for any <strong>custom mechanical keyboard</strong> is switch lubing. 
                Many switches come from the factory with a "scratchy" feel or a pinging noise from the internal spring. 
                Our service involves carefully opening each individual switch and applying high-quality lubricants like 
                Krytox 205g0 to the stem and housing.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This process significantly reduces friction, resulting in a smoother keystroke and a much deeper, 
                cleaner sound profile. We also offer "filming" for switches with loose housings, which improves 
                stability and further refines the acoustic experience. If you are looking for that specific 
                "thocky" sound, this service is essential.

            <h2>Full Assembly and Soldering</h2>
            <p>
                Whether you have a modern hot-swap PCB or a vintage through-hole kit that requires precise soldering, 
                we provide full assembly services. We handle everything from installing the stabilizers to 
                ensuring the plate is perfectly aligned. Every build undergoes a rigorous key-tester check 
                to ensure 100% functionality before it is shipped back to you.
            </p>

            <p>
                Stabilizer tuning is included with every full build. We clip, lube, and balance the wires 
                to ensure your spacebar and shift keys don't rattle. For those interested in the technical 
                details of different plate materials like FR4, Carbon Fiber, or Brass, you can find 
                engineering comparisons at
