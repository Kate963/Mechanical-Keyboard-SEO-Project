            <h2>Solving the "Mushy" Keyboard Problem</h2>
            <p>Mechanical Keyboard Hub was founded by a group of software developers who were tired of the "mushy" feel of standard membrane keyboards. We realized that the primary problem many professionals face is hand fatigue and a lack of tactile feedback during long hours of work.</p>
            
            <p>Our mission is to help you build a <strong>custom mechanical keyboard</strong> that matches your specific typing style. We believe a keyboard shouldn't just be a tool; it should be an extension of your hands. From selecting the right spring weight to choosing between linear and tactile switches, we guide you through every step of the journey.</p>
