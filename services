            <h2>Bespoke Keyboard Builds</h2>
            <p>Don't have the time to solder? Our professional assembly service handles everything from basic hotswap assembly to complex through-hole soldering. We ensure every <strong>custom mechanical keyboard</strong> leaves our studio in peak condition, tested for key-rollover and latency.</p>
            
            <p>Our most popular service is the "Full Tune-Up," which includes switch lubing with Krytox 205g0 and stabilizer clipping. This process removes the "scratchy" feel from stock switches and eliminates the annoying rattle often found in mass-produced boards. We take pride in our attention to detail, ensuring that every spacebar is perfectly balanced.</p>
            
            <p>If you are looking for a specific sound profile, we offer ultrasonic cleaning for vintage switches. This service is essential for restorers who want that classic feel without decades of dust.
